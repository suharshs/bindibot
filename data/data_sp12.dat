{"instructor_answer": "For the honors portion of the course, there are two parts:\n\n1. Honors Projects\n2. Own the Final\n\nWe will not actually start the honors course until later on in the semester, but here's an overview of what will happen. The following text is based on last year's course.\n\n1. Honors Projects\n\nThis semester we would like you to learn the basics of parallel computing and multi-threading. At our first course meeting we will introduce you to parallel processing, thread concurrency, and race conditions. We will demo a C++ API for parallel computing called OpenMP which you will be using in your projects. This tool will enable you to launch parallel execution of parts of your code without the hassle of explicitly spawning and killing new threads. Nonetheless, parallel processing requires a different way of thinking about problem solving in order to achieve best performance and efficiency while avoiding thread concurrency problems during execution.\n\nThe term project has an MP-style definition, but provides some flexibility and space for your creativity and your specific interests. It has been created specifically with parallel computing in mind, and while the sub-tasks of the project can in many cases be solved easily using sequential code, we want you to parallelize your programs with the use of OpenMP. Your final projects will be graded on how well you were able to use parallel processing techniques.\n\n2. Own the Final\n\nOwn-The-Final (OTF) presentations are accelerated review sessions for 225 students that are behind in the course. OTF are lead by honors students and there is usually on average 30 student attendees. There are around 13 sessions covering material from the very beginning of the course until the most recent topics. OTFs are being held in the last 2.5 weeks of the semester (see exact dates above and on the schedule page) and are 2-hour long sessions from 7pm to 9pm each day.\n\nEach honors student has to sign up to lead two OTF sessions (with up to two people per session). There will be present a course staff member each day to assist you during the presentation, but please be aware it's your responsibility to lead the OTF &quot;discussion&quot; session independently by yourself. Feel free to contact the TA signed-up for your session and make any arrangements (as needed) for your presentation.\n\nYou will have about two hours per sessions, and your goal should be to spend the first hour reviewing the old material (presentation slides, demos, etc.) and use the second hour to do practice exercises (passed out as a handout). You can find a link to OTF session schedule above with presentation slides and handouts from previous semesters that you can use as examples. Please don't reuse the materials from previous semesters. If you do, you will have to reasonably justify your choice and be well prepared on that material.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIn terms of time commitment: throughout the semester however much time it takes to complete about 1.5 to 2 MPs plus doing a few OTF sessions and preparation for them at the end of the semester.", "question": "I'm wondering how much workload should I expect in hours per week, since Honors part of wiki is not accessible.\n#honors", "subject": "Question about honors workload"}

{"instructor_answer": "If you go to the course homepage and click on &quot;Course Info&quot;, then scroll down to &quot;MP Resubmission Policy&quot;, you can see this:\n\nMP Resubmission Policy\nIt is unfortunate but true that some MP submissions result in an automated score of ZERO because the code has failed to compile in our testing environment. Because the type of mistakes that cause this catastrophic failure are often minor (for example, you might have capitalized a function name incorrectly), we are allowing general MP resubmission AFTER we have notified you of the score you received from our automated grader.\n\nAfter the original grading is complete, grades will be posted to your SVN and an announcement will be made on the course homepage. Our grading test cases will also be released to you.\nThe resubmission deadline will be set to the second midnight following the announcement, giving you at least 24 hours to fix any issues.\nThe last submission before the resubmission deadline will be graded with the same test cases.\nYour MP grade will be your original score or 75% of your resubmission score, whichever is greater.\nThis policy is designed to be a significant benefit to students who get a &quot;stupid ZERO&quot; for not following the specification closely enough or interpreting it correctly, but we are not limiting the resubmission policy to only those students. That is, anyone can resubmit any MP within the resubmission window. Note, though, that the policy is no benefit at all to anyone whose first score is above 75. No MPs will be accepted beyond the 24 hour resubmission window.\n\nFrom past experience, many students often leave finishing the MP until the regrade deadline. This is not helpful to you, and unfortunately often results in a 0 due to being unable to finish the MP by the regrade deadline. Planning your schedule so that you complete each MP at least day or two before the original deadline will significantly improve your grade and learning in the course.\n\nLabs (being worth significantly less of your grade) do not have a resubmission policy. No late labs will be accepted.", "question": "Pardon my ignorance or perhaps lack of creativity in Googling, but what is the regrade policy on MPs?

We've given you a public function you can use to test your code, but there's really nothing special about the fact that we're calling your function with head and tail.  For example, if we passed pointers to the third node and the third from the last node in a list, your function should reverse the portion of the list between those nodes, and leave the rest of the list alone.

I have two questions about this.\n\n1.) The reverse function we are implementing is being called from a public reverse() function, which accepts no parameters and calls the private reversal function we're implementing with parameters (head, tail). In the spec on the website it says to be careful and not assume that the head and tail pointers being passed are the head and tail of the list we're working with. How could this be possible? If the parameters are passed by a public function reverse() that accepts no arguments, and calls our private reverse function with the parameters head and tail, are the head and tail passed not necessarily the head and tail of the list the 'this' pointer points to?\n\n2.) If the head and tail being passed are not the head and tail of the current list, would the use of 'this.head' to refer to the head of the current list and the use of 'head' to refer to the pointer being passed as a parameter be a valid way to differentiate between the two?\n\n\n#mp3\n#mp3.1", "subject": "MP3.1 Reverse function"}

You usually can do the same things that code is doing and produce a similar leak in your code.\n\nAlso, a little trick can be helpful: you can run monad with --valgrind and it will run ALL the tests under valgrind (although it doesn't say they're running under valgrind):\n<pre>\n./monad mp2 --valgrind\n</pre>\nIf any of your tests segfault or have other memory errors / leaks, those tests will fail and you can see the valgrind output in the detailed output section at the end of monad's output ;)", "question": "So Valgrind doesn't detect any errors or leaks(it says 6 errors suppressed but a TA said that doesn't matter) with testscene.

{"student_answer": "Hey Derek, the best thing I can think of just to go back and make sure every single pointer is accounted for and right where you want it to be.  There's a lot that can go wrong, so one wrong pointer can mess things up really badly.  Make sure the right pointers are set to NULL and double-check that you haven't forgotten any pointer assignments when moving the ListNodes around.  For reverse(), you also have to remember that you could be reversing a sublist of some sort, not just a list.  That means that the first and last ListNodes of the chunk of the list you're trying to reverse could be pointing to (and getting pointed to by) other ListNodes.\n\nGood luck!", "question": "Right now, I'm stuck at a strange spot where reverse() works if and only if the first and last nodes are left untouched. For example, if I have a List&lt;int&gt; list that looks like {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} if I pass it reverse(head-&gt;next, tail-&gt;prev), it will return {1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6}. But if I do anything with head or tail like so:\n\nListNode * tempHead = head;\nreverse(tempHead, tail-&gt;prev);\n\nThe outputted list just looks like {1} and valgrind tells me of a memory leak concerning insertBack. I'm assuming this is because the head and tail pointers get manipulated within the reverse() function but how do I get around this? Running reverse(head, tail-&gt;prev) gives {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} which ended up truncating the 6 but I'm assuming that's because the class member 'head' got changed while reverse was not passed tail so weird things happen. reverse() and reverse(head, tail) works just fine.

{"student_answer": "This behavior is from implicit conversion from pointer to bool, and the fact string literals are not exactly type of <tt>std::string</tt>.\nA C-style string literal is <tt>const char * const</tt> by itself. Since there are no constructor signatures taking <tt>const char *</tt>, the compiler will try to find the second-highest priority overload by implicitly converting the parameters.\n\nIn C++, pointers can be implicitly converted to bool. That makes both overloads match the signature you're looking for. Then the priority between conversions kicks in.\n\nUnfortunately, pointer-&gt;bool conversion is language built-in and therefore has higher priority than const char *-&gt;string conversion (this is defined in standard library).

{"instructor_answer": "&quot;Garbage memory&quot; is memory that you have not allocated. When a pointer is created by not set to point to anything (no p = ...), it holds random bits as the memory address it points to. These bits have nothing to do with actual memory - they are just what bits were in that pointer variable's 8 bytes when the pointer was declared.\n\nA segmentation fault is &quot;unpredictable behavior.&quot; If you don't assign a pointer to an heap allocated or stack memory address, there is a small chance its bits will already point somewhere your program owns - although your program may be using that memory for something else! In that case, dereferencing the pointer will not give a segmentation fault, but will silently overwrite some of your other memory. This is what you are seeing happen in the first example. Running it again at a different time or on a different computer may still produce a segmentation fault.\n\nRunning both examples under valgrind will report memory errors in both places (the first is still a memory error even if no segmentation fault arose). If this were an exam question asking whether the above code (in either example) segfaulted, the answer would be yes. (Similarly, any memory error that is not the insidious bug can be called a segfault for the exam.)", "question": "I am reviewing, so please bear with me, I found there is some inconsistency in pointer.\nIt is said that the pointer is initially pointing at a garbage memory, but isn't (new int) make it points to a new garbage memory, even though we give it a cool name heap memory?\n\nAnd strangely,\n\nint *p;\nint x = 5;\n*p = x;\nis said to have seg fault in lecture, but my friend, he tested it and found no seg fault, while\n\nint *p;\n*p = 5;\nindeed will rise a seg fault\n\nThis rise the concern of whether the garbage memory is usable (first seems to prove that the garbage memory is a valid memory location that you can put values in, while the second shows that the garbage memory is too garbage to even hold a value).

{"student_answer": "You are not obliged to use the return value of the function call, if any. For example, <tt>cout::operator&lt;&lt;</tt> returns <tt>ostream &amp;</tt>, but you don't always use that.\nAssignment operator returning a reference is to allow the behavior you mentioned, <tt>c=(a=b)</tt>.

The CS 225 answer is to look at how the function scales as the size of the input increases. The best way to do so is to write a recurance for the function, but there are other ways to do it. For example, find in a linked list in the worst case has to look at all the nodes in the list, but only once for each.

The elements in the first list are NOT necessarily smaller than all the elements in the second list.\n\nFor example, if you have the following lists:\nlist1 = &lt; 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 &gt;\nlist2 = &lt; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 &gt;\n\nlist1.merge(list2); should give:\nlist1 = &lt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 &gt;, which involves interleaving/splicing the two lists together so that the output is still sorted.", "question": "So my merge function works for integers, and I thought we could assume they were sorted but my merge image shows that my function is just concatinating the two lists together.

What I was originally thinking was that the &quot;points&quot; vector was where we were going to store the points for our tree, and that within the vector they would be ordered according the method described ( the root being median in the 0 dimension, and being located in the index floor( (length - 1) / 2). I didn't know what the other vector of integers (point_index) was for. \n\nThen I came across the line:\n\n&quot;Because we don't want to modify the vector of Points passed in to the constructor, the actual work should be done on an vector of integers, which index into the Points vector.&quot;\n\nSo should the points vector be an effectively unordered vector of points (i.e. a copy of the one passed into our constructor)? And the vector of integers has the indexes of the corresponding points in the points-vector? That is, if the node that should be our median (that was in the original points-vector)  was at index k, then point_index[(n-1)/2] should equal k?  (i.e. the vector of integers is just an ordered list of &quot;pointers&quot; to the corresponding points in the points-vector)\n\nAt the moment, this form of implementation does not make as much sense to me as what I was originally thinking, so I wanted to be sure I wasn't misunderstanding something...again.\n\nThanks!", "subject": "understanding mp6.1"}

It operates very similarly to quickSort except your base case and recursive case are a bit different.

Are you going to be checking for unique mazes between runs? \n\nThe only reason I ask is that the examples online for how to randomize shuffle_random between runs uses some very unusual syntax.

{"student_answer": "Just a thought, but maybe some of that time is spent talking to students who might have cheated - if they're trying to push all grades at the same time.", "instructor_answer": "Grading takes about 2-5 hours. There are a few things that throw large delays into this process - for example, the parallel labs are new this semester, and new test cases that test something we haven't tested before had to be written for them. Running the intel tools from the autograder / monad took quite a while to work out perfectly.\n\nGrading is also a two step process: first we grade everything, which builds up a giant set of svn changes (adding everyone's grade.txt files). Then we commit this manually. This allows us to look through the grades before they get pushed to you, so that if things don't go correctly (the test cases don't give anyone a 100, or everyone gets a free 50%, or the test cases don't compile for a large portion of students), we can notice it and correct it before you ever see grades.\n\nMost of the MP standard deadlines were graded by the next day. A that-night turnaround is rather unlikely, because even if we started the grading at 12:15, it would be around 4am when the grader finished, at which point we'd have to look through some grades and commit everything - this part, naturally, took place the next day instead.\n\nMP regrades and lab grades aren't as huge a priority, because there's no resubmission deadline for them. The couple-day grading delay you notice is mostly because we're busy undergraduate students too (the person who's been doing most of the grading this semester is finishing up a busy senior year). Each week we have 1 lab, and 1-2 rounds of MP grading (extra credit or real/resubmission). That adds up to a lot of grading time each week, and  we have our own assignments due around those times in addition to just grading. I believe most of the labs were also graded overnight. 3-4 days is on the rather good side for a large college course though - most upper level courses take 1-2 weeks to get grades for anything back (I think that's horrible though, we're trying to be much better than that).\n\nAlso, just on the off chance - are you making sure to refresh your svn page in your web browser? SVN pages get cached, so unless you refresh the page, you might not see new additions to your svn in a timely fashion. There were some times when grading took 3-4 days, but if you were noticing it even for the MP x.2 due dates, that might be why.\n\nThe other delay is in getting grades to compass. We haven't been prioritizing this, because we've released your grades to you via SVN already. We haven't been storing your grades in compass as the &quot;master copy&quot; - they're just a view. So we actually have to upload them there; it's not just a matter of setting them viewable to you. This is fairly straightforward in the simple case, but I have to make excel formulas for the totals each time, and posting grades without updating the totals is problematic, so that's why they weren't pushed often. That's entirely my responsibility though, so if you feel things should have been done differently, you can blame (or just tell) me.", "question": "#confusing\nIt's the end of the semester and I can't help but feel curious about autograding process.\nSo normally it took 3, 4 days or even a week for me to get my MP or lab grades back on subversion.\nIt's the end of the semester, so let's be honest. :D\nDoes it actually take that long (3-4 days) to grade all of the students' MPs? \nOn which part of the grading process does it take the most time (grading, pushing the grades on subversion, etc. ) ?", "subject": "time spent on grading an MP"}

{"student_answer": "Here's the story.\n\nIn C, <tt>if</tt>, <tt>for</tt> and <tt>while</tt> operators all take integers as their operand. If the integer is 0, it is false; otherwise, it is considered true. C++ type <tt>bool</tt> is very weakly typed and works exactly like above.\n\nConsequently, binary comparison operators (e.g. <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>==</tt>) evaluate to one of the two values: 0 (false) or 1 (true). That means you can do pretty much anything; return from function, save to a variable, arithmetic operation or even bitwise operation. After all, it's just an integer.\n\nIt comes with one caveat, though, that you can't use something like <tt>a==b==c</tt> or <tt>a&lt;b&lt;c</tt> as your intuition suggests.
