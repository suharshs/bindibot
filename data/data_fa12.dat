{"instructor_answer": "Here's the strategy:\n\nFirst, find out what object files you need to create your program executable. Usually, each .cpp file will need to be compiled into an object file.\n\nFor each object files required, write a target in your Makefile. The format is the following (when target object file is target.o:\n\n<pre> target.o : dependency1 dependency2 ... dependencyN\n commands_to_build_target</pre>\nThe list of files after colon is dependencies. If any of those files get updated, your target will be rebuilt on make. For example, if you are going to compile <b>target.cpp</b> for this target and <b>target.cpp</b> depends on <b>target.h</b> and <b>another.h</b>, it should read\n\n\n\n\n<pre> target.o : target.cpp target.h another.h</pre>\n\n<i>commands_to_build_target</i> is the commands you want to execute to build <b>target.o</b>. This will usually be g++ compile or link commands.\n\n\nIn your Makefile, common sections are already factored out as variables. In our hypothetical situation of <b>target.cpp</b>, the second line would read:\n\n<pre>$(COMPILER) $(COMPILER_FLAGS) target.cpp</pre>\n\n\nDo the same for every single object files you need.\n\nThe last step is linking the object files to form an executable. Put another target, which should be the name of your executable, as the first target in the file. Put every single object files you've worked in the previous step as the dependencies.\n\nThis target should be roughly like this\n<pre>executable_name : target.o target1.o\n$(LINKER) target.o target1.o -llibrary_to_link -o executable_name</pre>\nwhere <em><b>target.o</b></em> and <em><b>target1.o</b></em> are the object files, and <b><em>library_to_link</em></b> is the name of library you want to link (usually png), and <b><em>executable_name</em></b> is the executable name.", "question": "<pre>\nmain.o : main.cpp sphere.h\n $(COMPILER) $(COMPILER_FLAGS) main.cpp\nmyprogram : main.o sphere.o\n $(LINKER) main.o sphere.o -o myprogram\n\nmyprogram : main.o sphere.o\n $(LINKER) main.o sphere.o -lpng -o myprogram\n</pre>\n\nThe above code is from my Makefile for mp1, I think I have to change the sphere.o to the png.o for both the lines.

There are a few things I don't understand. For instance, do we have to declare clear() and copy() in the scene.h file? and if so I'm assuming it is of type 'void' but I'm not sure. Then we would have to also define them in scene.cpp like we do other functions(i.e. void Scene::copy()) right? Lastly, we aren't passing anything to the copy function are we? In the examples in class we left it being called by copy(); and it just knew what to do. My question is then how does the function know what to copy from. Say I want to replace the line 'theRadius=rhs.theRadius' with 'copy()' when we are writing the code for the copy() constructor how do we know what to call the input? \n#mp2.2 #mp2", "subject": "Copy Clear helper"}

I was wondering if there was a way i could get an extra day or two to work on my MP considering my extenuating circumsances. Thank you. \n#mp2", "subject": "religious observance and mp2"}

{"instructor_answer": "The copy and clear functions are both private functions that have no return type (void). The syntax is going to be the same as other functions -- they're still functions that belong to a specific class.\n\nThe idea behind these helper functions is that we need the exact same logic in two places. We need to remove all memory associated with the object in both the destructor and in the assignment operator (to free our memory before we copy things over, or else we'll leak the old stuff), so we make a clear helper function to avoid having the same code in two places. Likewise, we need to copy members from one object to another in both the copy constructor and the assignment operator, so we make a copy helper function for that.\n\nAll the destructor needs to do is call clear, since clear by design releases all memory that the object is using. You should not think of the clear function as the destructor though. When an object is deleted or goes out of scope, the code in the destructor will run. The code in the destructor will call clear, which will free the memory. It's subtle, but you should think of them as two distinct ideas. The same thing goes for the copy helper and the copy constructor.\n\nHope this helps -- just ask if anything is still unclear.", "question": "I'm a little confused on the syntax for the copy() and clear() helper functions.

{"instructor_answer": "If that is C++ code, then I'm pretty sure it's broken. The types of those variables should be int pointers.\n\nOn the other hand, the <em>static</em> keyword has at least three meanings in C++ depending on the context.\n<ol>\n<li>For a global variable or function (not associated with class or struct), static modifier makes them local to current source file. They cannot be accessed by other files, and will not result in linkage errors when other source files have the variable or function of the same name.</li>\n<li>For a local variable, static modifier makes the variable retain its value across function calls. Beware, however: this is usually not thread safe and should not be used in multi-threaded application.\nThis use is somewhat related to 3, and I'm fairly sure this also exists in Java.</li>\n<li>For a class/struct variable or function, <em>static</em> modifier means that this particular variable or function is independent from any instances. They exist in global scope, and technically not different from global functions/variables (except access modifiers are applied).

Does it mean that it creates a variable on the heap with name &quot;a&quot; and &quot;array&quot;?  If so then does that mean we can just do a = 2; or array[0] = 5; and it'll change the values just like as if it were on the stack?\n\nI feel as though pointers are similar to the keyword &quot;static&quot; in Java, because the pointers are dependent on the value that's stored in the pointee, so if multiple pointers are pointing to the same pointer and the value changes, the value changes for all pointers.

{"student_answer": "Delete foo will always work. It will call the destructor before deallocating the object's memory, so it should work as long as the destructor works properly.\n\nIt is also not necessary to set foo to NULL first. The only real reason to set foo to NULL is so that if you accidentally try to delete foo again, it won't result in a segfault (the system will just do nothing and keep on going instead of crashing). Therefore if you're absolutely 100% sure that you're going to set foo to something after a deletion, it's fine to just directly assign foo.\n\nThe reason why delete[] foo doesn't do a deep delete is that it only deletes the memory holding the array. And if that array happens to be pointers, then you're not deleting the memory that those pointers point to.", "instructor_answer": "Let me elaborate a little bit more on behavior of delete/delete[].\n\nThe only difference between delete and delete[] is how they handle destructors.\nWhen you delete a pointer with <tt>delete</tt>, two things are performed: 1. destructor of object is called (if there is any) 2. memory is reclaimed.\nOn the other hand, <tt>delete[]</tt> calls destructors on every single element, if there is a destructor defined for given type.\n\nThe important key here is that given type must have a destructor defined if it is to be cleaned up. For example:\n<pre>Image **image_ptr_list = new Image*[24];\nimage_ptr_list[0] = new Image;\n...\nimage_ptr_list[23] = new Image;\ndelete[] image_ptr_list;</pre>\nNote that the type of array item is <tt>Image *</tt>: pointers are just integers; they are not a class type, so they have no constructor/destructor defined (similar to the reason you can't use dot (.) operator on pointers). That's why the above snippet results in memory leak.\n\n\nOn the other hand:\n<pre>Image *image_list = new Image[24]; // constructor is called on every single element\ndelete[] image_list; // destructor is called on every single element</pre>\nthe type of array item is <tt>Image</tt>. Image is a class type, so it can have constructors/destructor; if it correctly frees any resources inside the destructor, there will be no memory leak on the above snippet.", "question": "I spoke with Cinda and was enlightened to the fact that:\n\ndelete [] foo\n\nDoes not do a deep delete of the items in the foo array.

Perhaps this depends on the structure of the object which foo points to?\n\nOnce I'm sure the memory pointed to by foo is free, if I intend to point foo at another object, is it necessary to set foo to NULL first?\n\nJust trying to be thorough in my understanding.  thanks!\n\n \n#delete", "subject": "clarification on delete"}

{"instructor_answer": "There is a distinction between the List class and the ListNode class. The List class is very simple; you can consider it a wrapper for a linked list object. It just keeps track of the head, tail, and size of the linked list. The actual data is stored in the ListNode objects. These just have next, prev, and data elements. ListNode objects point to other ListNodes, creating the chain of ListNode objects.\n\nIn the above code, I'm assuming you're writing inside of the List class. That means &quot;this&quot; points to the current List object. When you say\n\n<pre>holder-&amp;gt;next=this</pre>\n\nyou get a type mismatch because holder-&amp;gt;next is a ListNode*, and &quot;this&quot; is a List*. You need to link prev and next to ListNode*. The line\n\n<pre>this-&amp;gt;prev</pre>\n\nis also an error because there is no &quot;prev&quot; member in the List class. this=holder is another type mismatch because you're assigning a List* to a ListNode*.

Each time a list is created and &quot;converted&quot; to node and passed to the subroutine, then &quot;converted&quot; back.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Why not just set the first parameter of mergesort to a List*? It can be shown that split and mergeWith function does no harm operating on the original list. Therefore I suppose there shouldn't be an issue in passing a list pointer, and the code could also be much more elegant by doing so. Am I allowed to change the type of the parameter? (It's a private member function).\n\n   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Another way may be to create another helper function for all the recursions. But considering mergesort itself is already a helper and things can be easy if just change a type setting, it seems quite unnecessary. \n#mp3 #mp3.2 #mergesort", "subject": "incompatible type ListNode* / List&lt;T&gt;"}
{"student_answer": "Based on the answer key, I think the correct answers are B and C. \n\n\nIt might be a memory leak because you create some &quot;space&quot; on the heap in the line \n\nint *c = new inta(a); \n\nAs for the invalid return type, myFun is supposed to return a pointer, while right now it is returning a memory address. \n\nThat's how I thought about it, but I maybe wrong.", "instructor_answer": "If you return a memory address of stack variable local to that function, it will point to an invalid address (and possibly overwritten).\n\nIf you're not sure, try running the following snippet:\n<pre>#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;\nusing namespace std;\nint *foo(int val)\n{\n    int x = val;\n    return &amp;amp;x;\n}\nint main()\n{\n    int *a = foo(5);\n    cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; *a &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;\n    cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; *a &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\nThe output will be different for the second cout. The first one prints correctly only because *a is evaluated to 5 <u>before</u> calling cout's stream operator. Once cout is called, *a is no longer 5, so next cout prints something else.\n\n\nAlso, the first one worked because int is a primitive type which does not clean up itself.

{"instructor_answer": "Lists are the public facing class. If I was using this class and I needed a List, I would make a List object and use the public functions like insertBack, insertFront, reverse, etc to do whatever I needed with the list. I wouldn't even be aware that ListNodes existed as a user of your List class! This is the idea of encapsulation -- hiding the implementation details from the user. I wouldn't need to know anything about the underworkings of your class to be able to use the List. The List contains a pointer to the start of the linked list and possibly variables such as the size of the list. It can also contain a pointer to the end of the list.\n\nListNodes are what we are using to implement the linked list. A ListNode contains data and pointers to other nodes in the list (possibly only the next node or also the prev node depending if it's doubly or singly linked). This is what we're using to make our List. Our List has one ListNode for each element in our linked list. We use these in our implementation of a List, but the end user never will see or interact with these nodes.", "question": "Really basic question, but what is the difference between Link and linkNode. \n\nI find is somewhat confusing because linkNode is in the Link class (at least for one of the practice exams). \n\nthanks \n#practiceexam #exam1", "subject": "Link vs. linkNode"}

{"student_answer": "Structs are essentially the same as classes, but differ in some areas. Classes have, by default, private members and structs have, by default, public members. Keep in mind that these are DEFAULT members. With both types you can still define public and prviate members, as well as functions and inheritance. Another area that is that you cannot use <tt>Template&amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;</tt> but not <tt>Template&amp;lt;struct T&amp;gt;</tt>. Also, sometimes programmers use structs as POD (Plain Old Data) types, meaning they only hold variables, but that's more of a convention.\nNamespaces are used to put classes, variables, functions, etc into groups that have a name. This is useful to prevent conflicts when, for example, variables have the same name. For example,\n<pre>#include&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;\n\nnamespace one\n{\n    int var = 4;\n}\n\nnamespace two\n{\n    int var = 10;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; one::var &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;and&quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; two::var &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;\n    return 0;\n} </pre>\noutputs:\n<tt> 4 and 10</tt>\nwhen run.\nUsing the <tt>using namespace</tt> declaration allows you to define a global namespace to use. So, for example, when we use <tt>using namespace std;</tt> we're saying that we are working with the std namespace by default. Once we declare that, we don't need to use <tt>std::cout</tt> each time we want to output something. Instead, we can just use <tt>cout</tt>.", "instructor_answer": "Jason's answer is great. I'd just like to add a little bit:\n<tt>class</tt> keyword in <tt>template&amp;lt;class T&amp;gt; </tt>is just a conventional keyword saying T is a type parameter: T can be a struct as well. Sometimes, people use <tt>typename</tt> keyword to reduce confusion from that name.\n\n<tt>using</tt> keyword lets you use some name from another namespace just like it is local to current namespace. For example,\n<pre>using std::cout;</pre>\ncreates an alias to <tt>cout</tt> in <tt>std</tt> namespace. This alias resides in current namespace, so\n\n\n<pre>namespace test {\n    using std::cout;\n}</pre>\ncreates an alias to <tt>std::cout</tt> in <tt>test</tt> namespace (i.e. <tt>test::cout</tt>).\n\n\n\n<pre>using namespace std;</pre>\nis basically doing<tt> using std::xxx</tt> for every name <tt>xxx</tt> in <tt>std</tt> namespace.", "question": "Since we can always declare a class.

This is used to create an array of string pointers of length maxOccupants to hold the names of people onboard and an array of doubles for their ages also of size maxOccupants.  The variable populationSize holds the number of people actually in the TARDIS so the aforementioned arrays will only have initialized/usable elements in indices 0 to populationSize - 1.  Is this all correct?\n\nIf so the function for adding people to a TARDIS (can't remember the name) would be kinda long right?  First we would have to check if it was full (populationSize == maxOccupants) and if it was we would have to copy over our old arrays into temp variables.  Then we would delete dynamically allocated memory in the arrays and then delete the arrays themselves.  After that we would have to increase maxOccupants in order to allocate bigger arrays and then copy all of the original data back into the new arrays (for this step would we just add 1 to maxOccupants?  the question didn't specify).  Finally we would add the last guy onto the end of our new arrays.  If the TARDIS was not full (populationSize &amp;lt; maxOccupants) we could skip most of those steps and just add the last guy at the end of our arrays?\n\nDoes this sound right?

However this is a hack and the error conditions in split are not appropriate for this kind of input to the helper function. My question is exactly what it means to split a list at a certain splitPoint. This is the way I think it is meant to work for the main split function:\n\n--split here if splitPoint = 0\nlistNode # 1\n---split here if splitPoint = 1\nlistNode # 2\netc...\n\nbut for the helper function:\n\nlistNode # a = start\n--split here if splitPoint = 0\nlistNode # a + 1\n--split here if splitPoint = 1\nlistNode # a + 2\netc\n\nAm I correct in my understanding of these two different meanings of splitPoint?\n\n \n#mp3", "subject": "split"}

If so, what would be a good test case to try to replicate that for my own testing, like using ints? \n\nThanks in advance for any help \n\n\n==7905== Memcheck, a memory error detector\n==7905== Copyright (C) 2002-2010, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.\n==7905== Using Valgrind-3.6.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info\n==7905== Command: ./monad schopra2/mp3 --provided\n==7905== \n==7918== \n==7918== HEAP SUMMARY:\n==7918== in use at exit: 59,402 bytes in 936 blocks\n==7918== total heap usage: 1,482 allocs, 546 frees, 96,429 bytes allocated\n==7918== \n==7918== LEAK SUMMARY:\n==7918== definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7918== indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7918== possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7918== still reachable: 59,402 bytes in 936 blocks\n==7918== suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7918== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.\n==7918== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes\n==7918== \n==7918== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v\n==7918== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 6 from 6)\n==7914== \n==7914== HEAP SUMMARY:\n==7914== in use at exit: 57,026 bytes in 884 blocks\n==7914== total heap usage: 1,448 allocs, 564 frees, 110,717 bytes allocated\n==7914== \n==7914== LEAK SUMMARY:\n==7914== definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7914== indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7914== possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7914== still reachable: 57,026 bytes in 884 blocks\n==7914== suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7914== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.\n==7914== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes\n==7914== \n==7914== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v\n==7914== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 6 from 6)\n==7927== \n==7927== HEAP SUMMARY:\n==7927== in use at exit: 57,117 bytes in 886 blocks\n==7927== total heap usage: 1,402 allocs, 516 frees, 92,752 bytes allocated\n==7927== \n==7927== LEAK SUMMARY:\n==7927== definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7927== indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7927== possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7927== still reachable: 57,117 bytes in 886 blocks\n==7927== suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==7927== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.\n==7927== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes\n==7927== \n==7927== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v\n==7927== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 6 from 6)\nA mp3/blockpng.cpp\n (more stuff, but probably not that important) \n================================================================\n\nRunning tests...\n================================================================\ntestInsertFront [1 pts] - passed\ntestInsertBack [1 pts] - passed\ntestReverse . .

{"student_answer": "For some reason lots of people don't seem to realize this, but valgrind does not actively probe/test your code looking for memory leaks. It's simply an accounting program that monitors what your code allocated and what it deallocated (that's a gross oversimplification of it I know). If you don't deallocate as much as you allocated then you have a memory leak.\n\nYou are responsible for testing and thinking of all the ways to test your program such that it covers all the corner/edge cases, etc. If your test coverage is 100% AND valgrind says there are no memories leaks then you're probably good. However, if your test coverage is only 25% and valgrind says 'No memory leaks' it means there are no memory leaks for the test cases you've implemented (which, again, only covers 25% of the possible cases).

{"student_answer": "Note: I couldn't tell if the original student answer was sarcasm or not, but I don't think it's an appropriate answer regardless.\n---\n\nThe first step is to obviously look at your midterm and see what you did wrong. Based on that, you should be thinking about why you made those mistakes. Did you honestly think your answers were correct? Were they hurried last minute attempts at getting a few more points? Were the questions way over your head and you just guessed? Now, since you have more time, you should consider reimplementing the questions you missed. Then you should attend the Exam Visitation on Monday to see a reasonable approach for answering each problem. Do your re-implementations match the course staff's answers? If not, is your implementation and their's equivalent? If your second attempts are wrong AND their approaches don't legitimately make sense, then you should definitely make an appointment with Cinda to discuss your options.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend that you work on programming with lists a lot more this weekend. Here are two links to some linked list material from Stanford. One is just the basics of linked list and the other is <b>18 different linked list problems</b> that you should try to implement. Solutions are included at the end but I don't think you should look at them until you're completely finished. While working on these examples you should be testing the way the course staff tests our programs. Doing everything possible to break your implementations. If you went to the GDB tutorial then now is when you start practicing your debugging with GDB. BEFORE you implement any of the problems you should have drawn out (on paper) your exact implementation and some pseudocode to implement it. You might not get it right on the first attempt but it's a good mental exercise.\n\nhttp://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf\nhttp://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdf\n\nAs for whether or not you can get an A, that's an easy calculation for you to do. The syllabus has the grade ranges and percentange that each type of activity is worth. You have your MPs, labs, and exam grades. From that you can calculate the number of points you'll need to get an A. If that number is less than the number of points left/available then you can get an A.

{"student_answer": "Edit: Replaced my original answer with this one. Hopefully it's more coherent but you're welcome to via the original by looking at the edits.\n\nMore information on this concept can be found by googling for &quot;template template C++&quot;. The idea of what I call 'nesting template statements' is actually called a <b>template template. </b>For what it's worth, this idea seems to be thought of as a bad one in general by the internet experts meaning that there is usually a better way to accomplish what you want without resorting to this.\n\n---\n\nA normal template for a function looks like\n<pre>template &amp;lt;class AnyName&amp;gt;\nAnyName sphere::print(...)\n{\n    /* Do stuff */\n}</pre>\n\nDoing this allows us to use AnyName in place of a specific type (e.g. int, double, etc.). Now, when we call <tt>print</tt> we have to specify the type of thing it should replace AnyName with via\n<pre>void foo()\n{\n    print&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;( ... ); // Says to replace every instance of AnyName with int in the print() function\n}</pre>\n\nThat's convenient because it generalizes things. However, what happens if the type we want to pass to <tt>print</tt> isn't a 'normal' (read: non-template) type. By that I mean, what happens if you want to pass a templated object to <tt>print</tt>?\n<pre>template &amp;lt;class NodeType&amp;gt; \nstruct Node { \n    NodeType data; \n    NodeType * next;\n};\n\ntemplate &amp;lt;class AnyName&amp;gt;\nAnyName sphere::print(...)\n{\n    // Do Something Interesting\n}\n\nvoid foo()\n{\n    print&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;( ... ); // wtf happens now??\n}</pre>\n\nThe <tt>sphere::print()</tt> function is expecting a simple, non-template type which it refers to as <tt>AnyName</tt>. But we've passed it a templated <tt>Node</tt>. The compiler doesn't know how to handle this situation, and so it's necessary to explicitly setup your <tt>sphere::print()</tt> function to explain it. In other words we have to tell the compiler that our templated <tt>sphere::print()</tt> function will be taking/receiving templated types. How do we do that??? Think about it. We have to tell the compile that our 'AnyName' placeholder is itself a template.\n<pre>template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt; // That's how we generally say that a class or function is a template</pre>\n\nNow, we that can describe an object as being a template we just need to put that into our <tt>sphere::print()'s</tt> template string. put that inside of our original template:\n\nBefore:\n<pre>template &amp;lt;class AnyName&amp;gt;\nAnyName sphere::print(...)\n{\n    // Do Something Interesting\n}</pre>\n\nAfter:\n<pre>template &amp;lt;   template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;   class AnyName&amp;gt; // print() can use AnyName as a placeholder and we've told the compiler that the AnyName placeholder is also a template.\n                                                 // BUT we're not able to use 'T'.

{"student_answer": "I'm interpreting this as needing 4 points which indicate the upper left 0,0; mid top 64,0; mid left 0,64; and mid img 64,64. I'm not sure yet if that should be the top level or I should use the 128's, i'll have to test some more.\n\nThe idea is to build a tree that has exactly 1 leaf for each pixel. Every time we add a level to the tree we can imagine we are partitioning all previous partitions of the image into 4 equally sized quadrants meaning we can stop partitioning once there is only 1 pixel in each partition. This is possible because we know the resolution must be a power of 2 and the image must be square. For example:\n\nIf the resolution is 2x2 there are 4 pixels in the image\nlevel 1 = 4 pixels per partition\nlevel 2 = 1 pixel per partition (STOP)\nSo for a resolution of 2 we need 2 levels for our tree\n\nIf the resolution is 4x4 there are 16 pixels in the image\nlevel 1 = 16 pixels per partition\nlevel 2 = 4 pixels per partition\nlevel 3 = 1 pixel per partition (STOP)\nSo for a resolution of 4 we need 3 levels for our tree\n\nIf the resolution is 8x8 there are 64 pixels in the image\nlevel 1 = 64 pixels per partition\nlevel 2 = 16 pixels per partition\nlevel 3 = 4 pixels per partition\nlevel 4 = 1 pixel per partition (STOP)\nSo for a resolution of 8 we need 4 levels for our tree\n\nIn general we will need $$\\log_{2}(resolution)+1$$ levels in the tree.\n\nOnce we have created a tree with enough leaves, we can go through the image and store each pixel in its appropriate leaf based on the x,y coordinates of the pixel. Think about how we can decide which partition (child) to go into at each level of the tree (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) based on the x,y (i.e. what ranges of x and y correspond to the 4 possible choices at each level of the tree). Hope this helps. (Disclaimer: there may be more efficient ways to do this, but this should help the intuition anyway.)", "question": "I am having a very hard time understanding how the tree is built.

{"student_answer": "Take at look at http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/cover2.jpg, which I think is a more intuitive depiction of a quadtree. The root is the top most (read: largest) square, and the smallest squares are all the leaves in the quadtree. Remember, the smallest squares represent each individual pixel in our PNG image (at least at first). The larger squares in the layer directly above the pixels/smallest squares is linked to the 2x2 partition of pixels/smallest squares directly below it. Each of those larger squares is an inner node (meaning not a leaf) in the quad tree and so it's color is the average of its children. This pattern continues all the way back up to the root. So the root is a single node whose color is the average of what's below it. It doesn't represent a specific part of the image; instead it represents the entire image through its children and their children, etc. Mind = blown :D\n\nAlso, take a look at http://www.koalastothemax.com/. Moving your cursor over a dot transforms it into its children. You can see that initially there is only one gray-ish dot. After transforming it (read: moving from the root to it's children) you'll see that you have 4 dots: 1 teal, 1 gray, 1 brown, and 1 gray/brown dot. If you continue traversing the entire quadtree you'll produce the original image. Until then you're left with nodes or dots whose colors are an average the pixels below it. After traversing it for long enough (but without traversing the entire quadtree) you can basically tell what the image is without seeing the original. This can be leveraged as a means of compressing images, which we'll be implementing with our prune functions I believe.\n\nLet me know if that helped clear up your confusion or if you still have questions.", "question": "Hello, I'm quite confused as to what the root for the quadtree to be.

{"student_answer": "From what you wrote it seems like you understand the basic concept of a quadtree but aren't really sure how to relate that to dividing up an image for the MP. You are correct when you say that the objective of a quadtree is to divide the image into smaller segments, however only the leaf nodes will contain the pixel data of the image, while internal nodes will hold the averages of its leaves. Perhaps a better way to understand it would be to think of each node having a size (or resolution) that correspond to a section of the image. For example if you are told to construct a quadtree of resolution 128, the root's nwChild should correspond to all data between the range of (0, 63) for x and (0, 63) for y, while the seChild should correspond to the ranges of (64, 127) for x and (64, 127) for y. As you build the tree recursively, you will cut the resolution by half until you reach resolution of 1, in which case you have reached a leaf node. Finally you have to read the pixel from the source image at your current position at store it into the node. As you may have noticed this implies you need to keep track of a nodes position with relation to the image, which can be done by creating x,y variables in QuadtreeNode or by passing them in the build tree method header. While nodes that have a resolutions of 1 (leaf nodes) should have there x and y values match up with there respective pixel variable, internal nodes will not directly match up with a particular pixel, rather a portion of an image, so your x amd y value should represent that (for example: by picking x,y to be the center of the region, or nwcorner, ect).

How did I get 18 you might ask: 18 = log_2(200000) (rounded up).\n\nSo, why is that the case?

{"instructor_answer": "Abstract Data Types and Data Structures are different.\n\nAbstract Data Types are things like a List, a Stack, a Queue, or a Dictionary. They are types that each have certain functions. Like the Stack ADT is a structure that supports the push and pop functions, and it has a first-in-last-out ordering structure.\n\nData Structures used as implementations of the above. We can have Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, or others. We have seen a Dictionary implemented with a BST or a AVL tree, but we could implement a Dictionary as an Linked List. It'd be a slow dictionary for look-ups since we'd have a O(n) look-up, but it is a possible implementation.\n\n The idea behind a ADT is that you don't need to know the implementation to use it. When you use the standard template library, you don't need to know what the underlying data structure is -- you just need to look at the documentation for the interface to use it properly. This abstraction layer helps us by letting us use the data type without knowing the gritty details of the implementation.", "question": "What exactly is the dictionary ADT?

Since the larger height is on the left side, you need a right rotate to fix it, so the answer would be a right rotation around the node containing key 6.\n\nC) To remove 10, since it has two children, you must first find the IOP and swap them before removing it.  The largest node in the left subtree is 8, so that's the one to swap.  After the swap you'll remove 6's right node (Now 10). Checking back up the hight difference at 6 is now left=1 right=-1 (a NULL tree has height -1) 1-(-1) = 2, so there is an imbalance at 6 again. (Damn that 6!)

{"student_answer": "This may help in understanding: https://cs.nyu.edu/~jchen/datastructures/huffmantutorial.htm\n___________________________________\n\nChase Geigle set up a tutorial video for Huffman encoding for the lab and explains it thoroughly using two queues: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWk6Y8Rd6bs&amp;amp;m=16&amp;amp;s=19\n___________________________________\n\nIf we start at the bottom of a binary tree and consider <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>d</b> to be leaf nodes, put in some order of frequency (e.g. <b>d</b><b>, a, c, b</b> in order from greatest frequency to smallest), then we can group two nodes with the smallest frequencies together. In this problem, those two nodes would be <b>c </b>and <b>b</b>. These two nodes would be the children of another node whose frequency is 12, the sum of those of <b>b</b> and <b>c</b>. Arbitrarily, this parent node can be named <b>bc</b>.\n\nWe then continue to look at the nodes with no parent (nodes <b>d, a, </b>and <b>bc</b>). Of these, <b>bc</b> and <b>a</b> have the lowest two frequencies of 7 and 5, so we group these under another parent node of frequency 7+5=12, and we can, again, arbitrarily name it <b>abc</b>.\n\nNow, the only nodes remaining with no parent are <b>d</b> and <b>abc</b>. We can then group these two together under another node of frequency 12+10=22 (although this frequency doesn't help us in solving this particular problem).\n\nNow, with the binary tree built, which should always be a full binary tree (i.e. each node should have either 0 or 2 children), we can look at the choices that the problem gives us. Your tree should look something like:\n<pre>            abcd (freq:22)\n           /             \\\n          /             abc (freq: 12)\n         /               /         \\\n        /               /         bc (freq: 7)\n       /               /           /        \\\nd (freq: 10)   a (freq: 5)    b (freq: 3)   c (freq: 4)</pre>\n\nThe bit code for each letter should be proportional in size to the number of edges that you have to walk from the root node (abcd) to the letter. Because of this, options (b) and (d) are immediately eliminated, since those give <b>d</b> a bitcode that's more than one bit long. For the same reason, option (c) is also eliminated, since, according to the binary tree, you must walk two edges from the root to node <b>a</b>, and option (c) gives <b>a</b> a bit code that is only one bit long.\n\nTo check if (a) is plausible, we have to assign each edge in our binary tree either a 0 or a 1. Option (a) already assigns a 0 to the path from the root node to <b>d</b>. Therefore, the edge from <b>abcd</b> to <b>abc </b>is a 1. Option (a)'s bit code for <b>a</b> is possible, since it's two bits long. The edge from <b>abc </b>to <b>a</b>, then, is a 0 (i.e., to get from <b>abcd</b> to <b>a</b>, we take path 1 to go from <b>abcd</b> to <b>abc</b>, and path 0 to go from <b>abc </b>to <b>a</b>, for a bitcode of 10).\n\nFrom <b>abc</b> to <b>bc</b>, then, the edge is a 1, which option (a)'s bit codes for <b>b </b>and <b>c </b>agree with. Since <b>b</b> and <b>c </b>are both 3 bits long and their last bits are unique, then option (a) is a reasonable solution to the problem (thereby ruling out option (e)).\n\nIt's also important to note that the bit code for each letter must be unique.

I don't understand how to traverse my function again. The way I'm doing it now is I am starting at the root (midpoint of vector) then I go down the tree by comparing the query against the current 'node' and if it is less I recursively call with my new point being the points located root-size/2 and root+size/2 if I need to go right, making sure to half my size each call until I reach size=1 which should be a leaf. This seems like a good way to do it, but at the same time I can't figure it out because of the cases of odd sizes. If we start with size 10 the first call handles everything fine, but then the next call when we do size/2 on the size of 5 we get 2 (because it is an int) but we might need it to be 3. Looking at our given example in testkdtree.cpp our root is value 4 then node to the right is 7 so root+size/2 gives us 6 and to the left it is 1 which also requires a shift of 3 not 2. So I tried going back and adding one more in the right case and subtracting one more in the left, but needless to say this gets me nowhere because then we get to the case where we want it to shift by the size/2 exactly.

{"instructor_answer": "While it would be a bit easier to sort the 'Points' vector during the KD-Tree building process, the run-time implications are non-negligible.\n\nConsider the case when you have an array of the form S = { 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 }.  Let's assume that our quicksort and select algorithms have the same pivot selection strategy, that being that they both guess that the middle value will be the best pivot (in this example, both algorithms will choose the value 4).  Observe that select will be done after just one operation (it will partition the array about the value 4 and place 4 back in it's original position, which is in the middle of the array, so the select algorithm is done) whereas quicksort must continue sorting the array after it's first operation (it will place 4 in the middle, but then it must quicksort the rest of the array).  Thus, select outperforms quicksort by an order of magnitude in the best case (select takes O(n) time in the best case and quicksort takes O(nlogn) time).\n\nIt's important to note also that the select algorithm has an equivalent worst case running time to quicksort.  When the select algorithm always chooses a value that's isn't the pivot (until the end, when the only value remaining must be the pivot), it won't finish until the array is sorted (consider select on the array T = { 1, 2, 5, 4, 3 } with pivot selection being the lowest position value).  That being said, the select algorithm won't generally run into the worst case, and thus should be used in lieu of quicksort (or any other sorting algorithm).\n\ntl;dr The running time of sorting the array at each step is generally more expensive than running the select algorithm at each step.  I'd recommend using the select algorithm.", "question": "So it seems that according to doxygen, they want us to use a quickselect and partition algorithm, in which we find the median at specific d and insert this into a new vector that represents the kdtree.\n\nIs it possible that instead of using quickselect to find median everytime, we pass in the vector Points which is initialized to the values of newPoints vector and just to quicksort on this Points vector at each value of d?

If the point remains in the median index at the end we know it is the median, otherwise we recursively partition the left or the right based on where the candidate median ended up.

Is it enough to simply iterate over my vector of &quot;cells&quot; and randomly take down walls, or must I randomly select cells in the maze, keeping in mind the fixed entrance and potential exits?\n\nI hope at least some of what I said makes sense. Thanks for your help.\n\n#mp7.2\n#makeMaze", "subject": "makeMaze"}

{"student_answer": "&quot;Obviously, no other cell except for (0, 0) should have a value less than zero.&quot;\n^This isn't necessarily true unless you have some logic that keeps this from happening. Think about what happens if you take down a wall between 2 cells that haven't been connected to cell (0,0) yet.\n\nAnyway I was reading your other post where you were pondering whether to iterate through the cells and take down random walls or choose random cells and random walls. I personally have done the second option and I think you might find the logic for this easier. However I would assume that picking cells randomly would have a longer running time. I'm going to try the Monad speed tests to see if it has an acceptable running time. I'll give you an update if I learn anything from it.\n\nUPDATE: It would appear my algorithm for randomly selecting cells and walls is too slow (timed out on monad for the large tests).  I was thinking about it a little more though and it might be easier to iterate through each cell several times.  This would allow you to drop the logic for making sure the cell will still be accessible if you choose to take down neither wall which seems like the most difficult part to me.  Then you can do one final run through where the only option is to randomly take down walls (no neither option) on any remaining cells that aren't somehow connected to the start (which I think can be done in just one iteration).  This last iteration won't be quite as random as the others, but if you have already iterated through the maze several times it probably won't really matter for our purposes.  Sorry if you have already thought of all this.  I'm sorta just typing as I think.", "question": "I'm stuck again. Here's the overview of my design. Let's find the flaw(s).\n\nI have the wall information stored in a vector of pairs of boolean values. I'm pretty confident in the way I'm accessing the vector in regards to a 2-D grid of squares. That's not the issue. I think the problem I'm having is in selecting walls &quot;randomly&quot; to take down.\n\nIt seems that there are 4 possible wall-removal tasks: 1.) Remove the right wall. 2.) Remove the bottom wall. 3.) Remove both the right and bottom walls. 4.) Remove neither wall.\n\nOf course, we cannot simply perform any of these tasks without making at least a couple of checks, one being to find out if the wall is a perimeter wall, or the other being a check to determine if taking down the wall would create a cycle. Also, if the option to remove neither wall is randomly selected, we have to check if that cell would then be inaccessible. So, this is getting pretty complicated.\n\nAnyway, I've written all the code, but it hiccups somewhere on the second &quot;row&quot; of the maze, meaning that there's an infinite loop. I have a 'while' loop that checks if the current cell is a root (i.e., negative value). Obviously, no other cell except for (0, 0) should have a value less than zero.\n\nSo, that's where I'm at. Monad passes 7.1 but times out for every other test for 7.2. I have helper functions that do what they're supposed to do, but I think my algorithm is flawed.\n\nDo you see any glaring issues here? I guess it would be easier to look at the code. So much for not being in the lab.\n\nThanks.\n\n#MP7\n#makeMaze\n#random", "subject": "Walls, Random, Union"}

Certainly if my DisjointSets object only contains 1 set then all the vertices are connected, which should mean that none are inaccessible. Moreover, if I've been following the &quot;no cycles&quot; rule, then I shouldn't be able to remove any more walls without creating one.

There's no need to reset it afterwards (in fact, it can be used to help debug!) The edge labels probably won't be very useful for this function.\n\nAs for your pseudocode, I'm not sure I understand the purpose of the stack. It looks like you're using it to find the path back to the start vertex, but there's no need to keep everything on the stack if you already have access to the parent info. Also, a fair bit of extra work is done that really doesn't need to be there.\n\nHint 1: Notice that the graph is <b>unweighted</b>.\nHint 2: You may not have quite covered this in lecture yet, but a BFS will give you the shortest path from a start vertex to any other vertex in an unweighted graph.\n\nThis problem will likely be easier after Friday's lecture.

I can complain all day, but I'd rather just try to get some advice. Let's focus on findShortestPath().\n\nI watched the TAs draw graphs on the board. Great, but I'm still a little confused about which labels/names I can/should change/use. First, should I care at all about the vertex name? If so, should I ever change it? What about the vertex label? Is that something I can change? If so, do I have to reset it to its original value before the end of the function? Does the same apply to edge labels? I can obviously use vertex and edge labels as I choose, but I'm struggling to figure out which of the two is more useful. I suppose it's a matter of implementation.\n\nSo, I'm going to just throw out a potential (yet incomplete/flawed) algorithm to solve this thing:\n\nPut the start vertex on a queue.\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n-----Pop a vertex from the queue (and maybe put it on a stack for later).\n-----Mark the vertex as visited somehow.\n-----Get the adjacent vertices and put them in a vector.\n-----For each adjacent vertex:\n------------If it hasn't been visited: (How do we determine this? Edge label? Vertex label?)\n------------Label it with its parent information somehow.\n------------Put it on the queue.\n(Now, the queue is empty and the stack is full.)\nPop a vertex from the stack.\nWhile the vertex is not the end vertex:\n-----Pop a vertex from the stack.\n(Now, the current vertex is the end vertex. We need to count the edges back to the start.)\nWhile the stack is not empty:\n-----Pop a vertex from the stack.\n-----If it is the parent of the previously popped vertex:\n------------Add 1 to a counter.\nReturn the count.\nEnd pseudo-crap.\n\nAs you can see, I have a general idea, but I'm not close. For starters, I'm not stopping once I've found the end vertex. I suppose that should be a check along the way.

{"instructor_answer": "1. Re-inserting a key is no different than inserting a new key. It's fine if it ends up somewhere else in the table due to other keys being removed. We'll still be able to find it if our flags are correct.\n\n2. The array has faster structure speed mainly due to caching, which you'll learn more about in 233. Essentially, an array is all contiguous in memory, and it's faster to keep accessing close locations in memory. Linked memory is all over the place so you can't access it as quickly. This is why we generally prefer arrays over linked memory, and it's why we implemented structures like heaps and the KDTree with an array as opposed to linked memory. \n\nWhen working with large structures you either need to allocate a massive array for linear probing (in which case you're wasting space when the table is nearly empty), or you could store pointers to the objects in the array, but with those pointers you've lost your caching advantage since you need to follow the pointer to access the data. Also, linear probing needs to resize more aggressively than separate chaining since it runs into more problems as load factor increases (due to clustering), and when you resize you need to copy all of the data which would be more expensive if your objects are large.", "question": "1.  I understand that with linear probing we have to keep flags for each cell telling whether the cell is empty, occupied, or empty but <b>WAS</b> occupied, so we know if we should keep probing when we doing a find or insert.  However, what would happen in the case where you remove a key from the hash table, but then re-insert the same key?  Does the key have to be returned to the same cell it was at the first time it was inserted?  In that case we would need to store more information about what was previously stored in the cell.  None of the implementations we saw ever mentioned this, so I wasn't sure if this is something we have to be concerned with or not.\n\n2.
